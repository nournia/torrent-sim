## Mulit-Agent Model Simulation of BitTorrent Mechanism

Simulation of BitTorrent mechanism using SPADE, a python based multi-agent platform.

I didn't finish this project so there are many **todos** to do:

- have and not-interest messages
- choke message
- have message
- add agent states
- add variety in peer bandwidth
- request for pieces instead of one piece
- transfer file segement via connection instead of piece message
